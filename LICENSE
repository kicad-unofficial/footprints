    To the extent that the creation of electronic designs that use 'Licensed
    Material' can be considered to be 'Adapted Material', then the copyright
    holder waives article 3 of the license with respect to these designs and any
    generated files which use data provided as part of the 'Licensed Material'.

This modified license is borrowed directly from KiCad's official libraries. It
is a permissive license that allows use of the libraries in commercial, closed
and non-commercial projects without restriction.

Use of these libraries in a project does not (by itself) require that the
design or any files generated from the design be licensed under the CC-BY-SA
4.0 License. You are free to use the library data in your own projects without
the obligation to share your project files under this or any other license
agreement.

However, if you wish to redistribute these libraries, or parts thereof
(including in modified form) as a collection then the exception above does not
apply. Redistributed library collections must be shared under the same license
agreement. Under these circumstances, the libraries must also retain attribution
information, including the license documents which are distributed with the
library files.
