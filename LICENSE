These unofficial KiCad libraries are licensed under the Creative Commons
CC-BY-SA 4.0 License, with the following exception:

    To the extent that the creation of electronic designs that use 'Licensed
    Material' can be considered to be 'Adapted Material', then the copyright
    holder waives article 3 of the license with respect to these designs and any
    generated files which use data provided as part of the 'Licensed Material'.

This modified license is borrowed directly from KiCad's official libraries. It
is a permissive license that allows use of the libraries in commercial, closed
and non-commercial projects without restriction.

Use of these libraries in a project does not (by itself) require that the
design or any files generated from the design be licensed under the CC-BY-SA
4.0 License. You are free to use the library data in your own projects without
the obligation to share your project files under this or any other license
agreement.

However, if you wish to redistribute these libraries, or parts thereof
(including in modified form) as a collection then the exception above does not
apply. Redistributed library collections must be shared under the same license
agreement. Under these circumstances, the libraries must also retain attribution
information, including the license documents which are distributed with the
library files.

Official manufacturer 3D model files are associated with each footprint where
possible (that is, they are made freely downloadable). These models remain the
property of their respective creators.

Where necessary the models have been rotated and translated to align with the
footprint but are otherwise unmodified. They can be identified by the presence
of `official` in the file extension, for example `NXP_SOT353-1.official.step`.

Any 3D model files without the `.official` extension are original creations and
are subject to the license terms described above.
