# Footprint Libraries

This is an unofficial collection of footprint libraries for KiCad 6.

## Conventions

- Name the footprint after the manufacturers internal package name, include any
  standard package names in the keywords field.
- Link to the datasheet or technical specifications page in the description field.
- Hide `REF**` field on the silkscreen layer.
- Fit the `REF**` field within the component outline, if possible.
- Don't set clearance overrides, even if specified by the vendor.
